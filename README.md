Implementing SIFTFeature Extraction Pipeline using LIRE and Hadoop 

This project provides interface for parallel processing of images. As there are no good libraries giving the power to apply vision algorithms in parallel this project aims at providing a convinient , userfriendly interface for Scientists to work on images.


**Components**

LIRE : luecene image retrieval library
JAVACV : java wrapper for openCV applications.
Hadoop : parallel procesising framework

**Test dataset :**
